#HardAssert:if HardAssertion getting failed:
>TC terminated immeadietly,set the status as Failed!
>UseAt:OpenBrowser,OpenUrl,LogIn like that place where we can use HardAssert
>Syntax:Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected, msg);

#SoftAssert:if SoftAssertion getting failed:
>TC not terminate,it will execute remaining line of code,but set the status as Passed!
>if you want Actual Status if SoftAssertion getting Failed,so for that we need to use:assertAll();

>ProcedureToUse:
1.Create new instance of Object SoftAssert 
 (separate for each TC:to avoid previous TC result in next TC)
>Syntax:SoftAssert softAssert1 = new SoftAssert();
 
2.Write a Statement at the end of TC:
>Syntax:softAssert1.assertAll();
>This Statement mark the TC as Failed, if any softAssertion getting failed.
